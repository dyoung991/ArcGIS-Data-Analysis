# ArcGIS-Data-Analysis

My name is Devin Young and and I'm an IT graduate from Bowie State University, currently serving as an Energy Climate Analyst Fellow within the Baltimore City Government.

This repository contains projects that I've done as an Energy Climate Analyst Fellow within the Baltimore City Government, involving ArcGIS mapping and data analysis within Microsoft Excel that breakdown key findings which have been used to increase the Baltimore City's energy efficiency.

Initially coming from an IT background has helped me quickly pickup GIS experience, and the GIS/data analysis experience I've gained within the Baltimore City Government has also increased my interest in helping develop and serve communties.
