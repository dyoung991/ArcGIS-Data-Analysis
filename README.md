# ArcGIS-Data-Analysis

My name is Devin Young and and I'm an IT graduate from Bowie State University, currently serving as an Energy Climate Analyst Fellow within the Baltimore City Government.

This repository contains projects that I've done as an Energy Climate Analyst Fellow within the Baltimore City Government, involving ArcGIS mapping and data analysis within Microsoft Excel that breakdown key findings which have been used to increase the Baltimore City's energy efficiency.

Initially coming from an IT background has helped me quickly pickup GIS experience, and the GIS/data analysis experience I've gained within the Baltimore City Government has also increased my interest in helping develop and serve communties.

Project Breakdowns  
  - Baltimore City Rec & Parks Lighting Projects:
      - Created a PivotTable within Microsoft Excel to illustrate which districts the Baltimore City Government's Energy Division will be taking on lighting upgrade projects for Baltimore City Rec & Parks, which types of lights will be upgraded (metal-halide, high-pressure sodium, mercury-vapor, or halogen), how many lights will be upgraded in each of the 89 sites, and how much the annual kWh savings would be for the Baltimore City as a result of carrying out these upgrades.
      - Used ArcGIS to supplement that PivotTable with a proportional map & heat map (along with their corresponding legends) to illustrate the findings from the PivotTable previously mentioned on a high-level, to Baltimore City Rec & Parks and the Energy Division within Baltimore City's Department of General Services.

  City of Baltimore Publicly Available EVSE Mapping Project (in ArcGIS):
      - Gathered the required data and separated it into different excel sheets to create an ArcGIS Map of the locations of Publicly Available EVSE stations within the City of Baltimore, which included the location, address	longitude/latitutde coordinates, property owner, accessibility (type), vendor (name), number of ports, and level (charger level), which I configured a popup to display when users click on an icon on the map.

  Fleet Energy Use - FY23 to FY24 Cost Analysis Comparison):
      - Analyzed energy data for fleet operated buildings within energy cap to compare the costs/level of utilization of energy over the past two fiscal years.
